# ðŸ§  DSA (C & Python)

Welcome to **DSA (C & Python)**, a comprehensive repository containing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in both **C** and **Python**, alongside **LeetCode problems** that demonstrate practical usage of these implementations.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repository is built to:

- Solidify understanding of core DSA concepts in **C** and **Python**.
- Maintain a library of clean and well-documented implementations.
- Apply DSA knowledge to real-world problems from platforms like **LeetCode**.
- Serve as a revision resource for coding interviews and other exams.
